## This Terraform project deploys an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a focus on optimizing security, cost, and performance. It includes the creation of public and private subnets across multiple availability zones, a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway for private subnet internet access, and a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, ensuring secure and cost-effective communication with the S3 service without going through the public internet.

# Features:

    Creates a customizable VPC with best practices for multi-AZ redundancy.
    Configures public subnets designed for hosting load balancers or reverse proxies.
    Establishes private subnets for application servers with controlled internet access.
    Implements a NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.
    Sets up a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, allowing secure and efficient access without public internet routing.
    Offers configurable variables for easy customization based on your specific requirements.
    Ensures the infrastructure is defined as code, enabling version control and reproducibility.

# Usage:

    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Customize the terraform.tfvars file with your desired parameters.
    3. Run terraform init and terraform apply to deploy the infrastructure.
